- Ursina game engine

---

##  Installation & Running

### 1. Install Ursina

```bash
pip install ursina
````

### 2. Save the Game Code

Save the provided Python code in a file, e.g., `main.py`.

### 3. Run the Game

```bash
python main.py
```

---

##  Project Structure

```
/block-builder
â”œâ”€â”€ main.py         # Game logic
â”œâ”€â”€ grass.png       # Block texture (optional)
â””â”€â”€ README.md       # You're reading it!
```

> Make sure the `grass.png` file is in the same folder as `main.py`. You can use any 64x64 grass texture image.

---

##  How It Works

* The game creates a 20x20 grid of cubes using nested loops.
* `FirstPersonController` allows free movement in first-person.
* The `input()` function checks if a block is hovered when clicking:

  * Left-click adds a new cube in the clicked direction.
  * Right-click removes the hovered cube.
